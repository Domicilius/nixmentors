ZFS

A wise man once said:

"ZFS? I hardly knew her..."

You all today will become greater than that man.


What is ZFS?
------------

ZFS is like the nuclear cannon of Solaris. It is their Ace of
spaces and it is the reason that the system is arguably the best
choice for high load fileserving. The best way I can describe it
is like...


### Say you had a Burrito...

This burrito could set quotas on how much any one person could eat,
and it could also

Okay sure, I knew that analogy was kind of a stretch, and most likely
was a sad attempt to describe this incredible technology all wrapped (hehe)
into one golden, warm, marriage killing toilet destroyer.

Let's try this again...

Go with me on this one. Say you wanted to create the worlds greatest
fileserver. You would most certainly need a few things to ensure
your supremacy.

* Redundancy, either by [Mirroring][mirroring] providing [Parity][Parity]
* Speed, most likely from [Striping][Striping]
* Backups/snapshots
* All sorts of cool features (not limited to)
    * [NFS][NFS]
    * [Samba][Samba]
    * [Access Control][AccessControl]
    * [Disk Quota][DiskQuota]
    * [Hot Spares][HotSpares]
    * [Etc][ZFSProperties]
